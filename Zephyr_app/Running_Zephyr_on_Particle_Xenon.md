#Running *Zephyr* on *Particle Xenon* board

Except for board identification in `west build` command set to `west build -b particle_xenon`, everything runs like *nRF52840* board. That includes flashing, debuging and accessing *RTT* console through *JLink*. Board identification for *JLink* is still `nRF52840_xxAA`.
